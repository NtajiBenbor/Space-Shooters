## Overview

The task from Havard Cs50 was to create a Game or Tell a story using several sprites and scripts using the scratch programming Language. this document provides a detailed explanation of the methodology and technologies used at different points; from inception to finalization of this project in order to achieve this end result.

## My process

I started off by creating the basic structure of this game using Scratch, then I gradually added different sprites and wrote the logic to control these sprites as per the guidelines in the problem set description. I then created a repository for this project on github.   


### Built with

- Scratch 3.0

### What I learned

- I learned about conditionals
- Loops.
- Events.
- Arguments.


### Continued development
 I want to get better at programming by learning about the fundamentals of programming in the future.
