## My process

I started off by creating the basic structure of this game using scartch, then i gradually added different sprites and wrote the logic to control these sprites as per the guidelines in the problemset description. I then created a repository for this project on github.   


### Built with

- Scratch 3.0

### What I learned

- I lerand about conditionals
- Loops.
- Events.
- Arguements.


### Continued development
 I want to get better at programming by leaning about the fundamentals of programing in the future.
